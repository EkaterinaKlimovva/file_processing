# file_processing
Implement file processing in a user-defined folder. Each computational task should be designed in isolation (there is no dependence on other tasks). The operation of each computational function is determined by the input arguments (target folder; parameters for solving the problem N, K, M, if required). The result of solving the problem is the return value of the function. Each task must be implemented in two ways: using technology LINQ and without using LINQ technology. Estimate the execution time of each task using the Stopwatch object. In structuring, it is recommended to use the "Strategy" pattern - to introduce an interface with
4 computational functions and solver classes (hp, LinqSolver and NoLinqSolver), which provide implementations of computational functions in different ways (with and without Linq). Think over and implement a user interface with Windows Forms to set search parameters and output results. Use the DataGridView and Chart elements to display the results.
